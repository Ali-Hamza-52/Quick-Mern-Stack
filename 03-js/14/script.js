    How to make conditions

    relational and logical operator

    Relational Operator
        compare two values (6 > 7)
        > < >= <= != === ==
    Logical Operator
        compare two relational equations (5>6) && (6<9)
        && || !

    Condition must have at least one relational operators
        we can do    
            if(2 > 3)

            taking number from user and should be greater than 2 and less then 5
            if(number>2)
                if(number<5)
            if(number > 2 && number < 5)

        if(num) // it is wrong when it have number
        if("user type value") // it is wrong when it have string
        if(isBlast) // it is good when it have boolean(true ,false)
        if(number === 1) // it is true
        if(string === "hi") // it is correct
        if("hi") // it is wrong


    if (condition) {
        Code to run if condition is true
    } else {
        Code to run if condition is false
    }
